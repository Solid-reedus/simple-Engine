# Bare-Bones OpenGL Engine

A very minimal "engine" built with OpenGL, created to explore and learn the fundamentals of graphics programming.

## About

This project is a simple OpenGL-based engine created as a learning exercise. It's designed to be lightweight and bare-bones, ideal for beginners or developers who want to explore the basics of rendering and engine development.

> **Note**: This engine is a first-year project by a beginner in game programming, so it’s not intended for production use. Please don't expect extensive features or optimizations.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Download/Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Unzip Assimp**:
   - Navigate to `openglGame/libraries/include`.
   - Inside this folder, you’ll find a zipped file named `assimp x64-windows`.
   - Unzip this file and remove the `.gitignore` file that comes with it to enable loading of necessary assets.

### Dependencies

This project relies on:
- **OpenGL**: For rendering graphics.
- **GLM**: For mathematical operations.
- **GLFW**: For handling window and input events.
- **Assimp**: For importing 3D models (requires unpacking, as noted above).
- **KHR**: Khronos Group extensions, which help with compatibility and access to OpenGL extensions.

Ensure that these libraries are available and correctly referenced within your environment.

## Usage

Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with the code. It’s open domain, so you’re welcome to use it however you’d like.

## Contributing

While this project was primarily created for learning purposes, contributions are welcome. If you’d like to add functionality, improve performance, or help with documentation, feel free to submit a pull request.
